## Background

Christmas lights on trees are beautiful, but the light strings are difficult to install.
It is possible to install lights in conifer trees using a ladder and pole.

Example, _[Amazon B0BN6MBTHW](https://www.amazon.ca/Telescopic-Telescoping-Installation-Birdfeeders-Lightweight/dp/B0BN6MBTHW)_

This works when the tree is less than 10 metres tall _(35 feet)_, noting that it is difficult to remove the lights. 
Taller trees and deciduous trees require a boom-lift, due to the tree's height and limited access between branches.

Home Depot rents these boom-lifts:

| Height    | Height  | Rental cost, per day _(Canadian dollars, 2024)_ |
| :-------: | :-----: | :---------------------------------------------: |
| 10 metres | 35 feet | $370                                            |
| 15 metres | 50 feet | $490                                            |

It's a significant investment; especially if you plan to remove the lights after the season, or when you consider the maintenance task of replacing lights that burn out.
