## Background

Christmas lights on trees are beautiful, but the light strings are difficult to install.
It is possible to install lights in conifer trees using a ladder and pole.

Example, _[Amazon B0BN6MBTHW](https://www.amazon.ca/Telescopic-Telescoping-Installation-Birdfeeders-Lightweight/dp/B0BN6MBTHW)_

This works when the tree is less than 10 metres tall _(35 feet)_, noting that it is difficult to remove the lights. 
Taller trees and deciduous trees require a boom-lift, due to the tree's height and limited access between branches.

Home Depot rents these boom-lifts:

| Height    | Height  | Rental cost, per day _(Canadian dollars, 2024)_ |
| :-------: | :-----: | :---------------------------------------------: |
| 10 metres | 35 feet | $370                                            |
| 15 metres | 50 feet | $490                                            |

It's a significant investment; especially if you plan to remove the lights after the season, or when you consider the maintenance task of replacing lights that burn out.


### Background, Light Options To Consider

| Light Option | Image                                        | Notes |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------------: | :---: |
| None         | ![](/readme_assets/tree_plain.png)           |       |
| Draped       | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_draped.png)   | String lights draped over the tree's canopy. This does not look good. |
| Spiral       | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_spiral.png)   | String lights wrapped around the tree's canopy. This looks good, but takes a long time to install. |
| Wrap         | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_wrap_v2.png)  | String lights wrapped around the tree's trunk and branches. This looks good, but takes a long time to install. |
| Vertical     | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_vertical.png) | String lights hanging from tree branches, similar to a weeping willow's hanging branches. |
| Balls        | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_balls.png)    | There are consumer options available, with single colours, and up to 300 mm diameter. There are larger options, but they are intended for use on the ground since they are heavy or have high wind resistance. |
| Flood        | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_flood.png)    | Inexpensive light at the base of the tree. Typically floods the tree with a single colour of light, with minimal range. It can get covered from snowfall. |
| Laser        | ![](/readme_assets/tree_lights_laser.png)    | Inexpensive light at the base of the tree. It makes many small dots on the tree, but also has a long overshoot onto surfaces behind the tree. It can get covered from snowfall. |


### Background, Power Sources For Lights

* AC mains power, as how most North American christmas lights are powered.
* Low voltage DC cable run up the tree. 12 VDC custom outdoor wiring does not require inspection from Electrical Safety Authority in Ontario Canada. 
* Wireless power transimission, such as Disney's: _[Wireless Power Transmission Safely Charges Devices Anywhere Within A Room](https://la.disneyresearch.com/innovations/wireless-power-room/)_.
* Solar panels on the lights, with a battery.
* PoE _Power Over Ethernet_. The passive option uses 24 VDC, the active options use 48 - 52 VDC.


### Background, Installation Methods To Consider

1. Ladder and pole.
2. Pole with a hook.
3. Pole with a catch release.
4. Climbing trees.
5. Drone with a catch release
6. Lights installed onto a drone. The drone would remain in the tree.
7. Pulleys installed into trees, which then allow the lights to be raised and lowered. This is similar to a flag pole.


### Background, Design Requirements

1. Colours and white available _(preferably user selectable after installation)_
2. Lights visible at dusk.
3. DC low voltage, or existing approved device.
4. IP54 minimum, to allow for rain and snow melt.
5. Approved FCC or Industry Canada components to not cause RF issues. This is only relevant if the devices include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or similar radio communication.


### Background, Design Intent

There is an unmet design space for Light Balls and Vertical Strands that can be installed in tall trees.
It is uncommon to see Spiral or Wrapped string lights on tall trees due to the installation cost.
People sometimes add Flood or Laser lights, but the light concentrates near the base of the tree.
The goal is to design a light source that:

1. Can be installed in a large tree using methods such as a ladder-and-pole, a boom-lift, or using a drone _(preferred option)_. 
2. Can be powered from this location. Any safe power method is acceptable, but it should consider installation difficulty, maintenance burden, and reliability.
